[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/fkooman/php-oauth-as.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/fkooman/php-oauth-as)

# Introduction
This is an OAuth 2.0 Authorization Server written in PHP that is easy to 
integrate with your existing REST services, whether or not they are written in
PHP. It will require minimal changes to your existing software.

Part of the development of this software was made possible by 
[SURFnet](https://www.surfnet.nl).

# Features
* Authorization code and implicit grant profile support
* `BasicAuthenication` Backend (using username/password)
* `MellonAuthentication` Backend (SAML)
* PDO database backend support
* Token introspection for resource servers
* Management interfaces to manage client registration and authorized clients

# Installation
The prefered method of installation is to use the RPM packages. The RPM 
packages can for now be found in the 
[repository](https://copr.fedoraproject.org/coprs/fkooman/php-oauth/). For 
setting up a development environment, see below.

To enable the repositories on Fedora do the following:

    $ sudo yum -y install yum-plugin-copr
    $ yum copr enable -y fkooman/php-base
    $ yum copr enable -y fkooman/php-oauth
    $ yum install -y php-oauth-as

Restart Apache:

    $ sudo service httpd restart

You can now configure the OAuth server in `/etc/php-oauth-as/oauth.ini` and set
up the entitlements in `/etc/php-oauth-as/entitlements.json` for access to the
management API. After this is done you can initialize the database and add some 
clients:

    $ sudo -u apache php-oauth-as-initdb
    $ sudo -u apache php-oauth-as-register clients.json

The `clients.json` file contains some information on the installation clients
you want to install. These could for instance contain the client management and 
authorization management clients. See below for more information on these 
clients. If you want to use the hosted management clients on `php-oauth.net` 
you can run the following:

    $ sudo -u apache php-oauth-as-register https://www.php-oauth.net/app/config.json

This is actually secure because the access token used to access the API never
leaves the browser. Now you can use the management applications on 
[https://www.php-oauth.net](https://www.php-oauth.net) to manage your server on
`https://localhost/php-oauth-as`. The default for the installed RPM packages, 
and the development environment below.

# Development Requirements
On Fedora/CentOS:

    $ sudo yum install php-pdo php-openssl httpd'

You also need to download [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/).

The software is being developed on Fedora 21, but should run on CentOS 6 and 
CentOS 7 and should also work on RHEL 6 and RHEL 7.

# Development Installation
*NOTE*: in the `chown` line you need to use your own user account name!

    $ cd /var/www
    $ sudo mkdir php-oauth-as
    $ sudo chown fkooman.fkooman php-oauth-as
    $ git clone https://github.com/fkooman/php-oauth-as.git
    $ cd php-oauth-as
    $ /path/to/composer.phar install
    $ mkdir data
    $ sudo chown apache.apache data
    $ sudo semanage fcontext -a -t httpd_sys_rw_content_t '/var/www/php-oauth-as/data(/.*)?'
    $ sudo restorecon -R /var/www/php-oauth-as/data
    $ cp config/oauth.ini.defaults config/oauth.ini

Edit `oauth.ini` to match the configuration. You need to at least modify the
following lines, and set them to the values shown here:

    entitlementsFile = "/var/www/php-oauth-as/config/entitlements.json"
    dsn = "sqlite:/var/www/php-oauth-as/data/db.sqlite"

Now continue with the configuration:

    $ cp entitlements.json.example entitlements.json

You can modify the `entitlements.json` file to list your own user ID to 
specify the `manage` entitlement. By default the `admin` user ID has this
entitlement.

    $ sudo -u apache bin/php-oauth-as-initdb 
    $ sudo -u apache bin/php-oauth-as-register https://www.php-oauth.net/app/config.json

Copy paste the contents of the Apache section (see below) in the file 
`/etc/httpd/conf.d/php-oauth-as.conf`.

    $ sudo service httpd restart

If you ever remove the software, you can also remove the SELinux context:

    $ sudo semanage fcontext -d -t httpd_sys_rw_content_t '/var/www/php-oauth-as/data(/.*)?'

# Apache
This is the Apache configuration you use for development. Place it in 
`/etc/httpd/conf.d/php-oauth-as.conf` and don't forget to restart Apache:

    Alias /php-oauth-as /var/www/php-oauth-as/web

    <Directory /var/www/php-oauth-as/web>
        AllowOverride None

        Require local
        #Require all granted

        SetEnvIfNoCase ^Authorization$ "(.+)" HTTP_AUTHORIZATION=$1
    </Directory>

Restart Apache with `service httpd restart`.

# Templates
The template `views/askAuthorization.twig` can be copied to 
`config/views/askAuthorization.twig` and modified there. One can update the 
HTML and also point to an alternative CSS style to customize it for your
particular API service.

# Authentication
There are currently three plugins provided for user authentication:

* `BasicAuthentication` - Simple static username/password authentication 
  configured through `config/oauth.ini` (**DEFAULT**)
* `MellonAuthentication` - Plugin for SAML authentication

You can configure which plugin to use by modifying the 
`authenticationPlugin` setting in `config/oauth.ini`.

You do need to configure these authentication backends separately. See the 
respective documentation for those projects.

## Entitlements
This OAuth server also uses *entitlements*. Entitlements are certain access 
rights a particular user using an API has. For instance, you can configure a
user to have `manage` rights on the API of the Authorization Server. 

These entitlements can be provided through a static configuration file 
in `config/entitlements.json`. 

Entitlements are needed because sometimes you want users to be able to use the
provided API, but not be able to manage client registration, or on some APIs, 
some users have more rights. For instance, a special user can access data for
all users through the API while regular users can only access their own data.

The API for managing the authorization server supports the 
`http://php-oauth.net/entitlement/manage` entitlement in order to be able to 
modify application registrations. If for instance the authentication backend 
has a user `admin` and you want to give this user the entitlement to manage the 
application registrations, you would put that in `config/entitlements.json`:

    {
        "admin": [
            "http://php-oauth.net/entitlement/manage"
        ]
    }

Now, whenever the `admin` user successfully authenticates it can manage clients
through the API. Users with other IDs will not be able to manage the clients.

# Housekeeping
In order to delete stale tokens a housekeeping script is available, 
`php-oauth-as-housekeeping`. It should be ran periodically using `crontab(5)` 
or a similar mechanism. For example, to run it every night 5 minutes after 
midnight use the following as a cron entry:

    5 0 * * *     /usr/bin/php-oauth-as-housekeeping

When using SQlite this script should be run as the same user as the web server,
or as root (not recommended).

# Management Clients
There are two management clients available:

* [Manage Applications](https://github.com/fkooman/html-manage-applications/)
* [Manage Authorizations](https://github.com/fkooman/html-manage-authorizations/)

These clients are written in HTML, CSS and JavaScript only and can be hosted on 
any (static) web server. See the accompanying READMEs for more information.
For your convenience they are hosted on 
[https://www.php-oauth.net](https://www.php-oauth.net) so you do not need to 
setup the applications yourself and can immediately use the hosted versions. 
The hosted version points to `https://localhost/php-oauth-as/` as the base URL,
so you can (for now) only use them for development purposes or the Docker 
image.

# Resource Servers
If you are writing a resource server (RS) an API is available to verify the 
`Bearer` token you receive from the client. Currently a draft specification
`draft-richer-oauth-introspection` is implemented to support this.

An example, the RS gets the following `Authorization` header from the client:

    Authorization: Bearer 40da7666a9f76b4b6b87969a7cc06421

Now in order to verify it, the RS can send a request to the OAuth service:

    $ curl -k -s https://localhost/php-oauth-as/introspect.php?token=40da7666a9f76b4b6b87969a7cc06421 | python -mjson.tool
    {
        "active": true,
        "client_id": "2352ea44-612d-448b-be10-6e29562e5130",
        "exp": 1409564548,
        "iat": 1409560948,
        "scope": "http://php-oauth.net/scope/manage",
        "sub": "admin",
        "token_type": "bearer",
        "x-entitlement": "http://php-oauth.net/entitlement/manage"
        ]
    }
    
The RS can now figure out more about the resource owner. If you provide an 
invalid access token, the following response is returned:

    {
        "active": false
    }

If your service needs to provision a user, the field `sub` SHOULD to be used 
for that. The `scope` field can be used to determine the scope the client was 
granted by the resource owner.

There is a proprietary extensions to this format: `x-entitlement`. It gives the 
entitlement values as a space separated list of entitlements, just like the 
`scope` field.

A plugin for `fkooman/rest`, `fkooman/rest-plugin-bearer` is available to 
integrate with this OAuth 2.0 AS service using 
[Composer](https://getcomposer.org). Or see the project 
[site](https://github.com/fkooman/php-lib-rest-plugin-bearer).
